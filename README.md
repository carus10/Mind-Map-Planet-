## Why Mind Map Planet?

Keeping ideas scattered across apps or temporary notes makes it easy to lose track. Mind Map Planet keeps your thoughts in one place and helps you structure them with a simple workflow:

1. Create a note in seconds  
2. Place it into a folder (topic/project/category)  
3. Revisit, refine, and keep moving
